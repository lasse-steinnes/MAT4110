# MAT4110 - Assignment 2: Optimization methods
Git for Assignment 2 in Introduction to Numerical Analysis at UiO.

### Main overview
* The problem description can be found [here](https://github.com/lasse-steinnes/MAT4110/blob/master/Assignment2/Report/mat4110oblig2.pdf), and the report can be 
  [here](https://github.com/lasse-steinnes/MAT4110/blob/master/Assignment2/Report/MAT4110_assignment2_Steinnes2020.pdf)
* The main theme was optimization methods, with fixed point iteration and Newton's method, applied to solve a 2.nd order ODE.

### Code: Link and description of programmes
- [main.py]https://github.com/lasse-steinnes/MAT4110/blob/master/Assignment2/main.py) : Runs the other programmes and provide user options through terminal.

- [optimize.py](https://github.com/lasse-steinnes/MAT4110/blob/master/Assignment2/optimize.py): Provides the Optimize class containing newtonODE and fixedpointODE   solvers.

- [test_optimize.py](https://github.com/lasse-steinnes/MAT4110/blob/master/Assignment2/test_optimize.py): Provides a pytest in the case of a known solution. The test can be performed with pytest in the terminal.
